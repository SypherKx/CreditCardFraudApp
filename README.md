# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Logistic Regression**.  
This project includes both a Python script for training & evaluation and a **Streamlit web app** for interactive testing.

## 📌 About the Project
Credit card fraud is a major financial crime worldwide. Detecting fraud in real-time is challenging due to:
- Highly **imbalanced datasets** (very few fraud cases compared to legit ones).
- Need for **fast and accurate predictions**.

This project:
- Uses a **balanced dataset** (fraud vs legit sampled equally).
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier.  
- Provides a **Streamlit Web App** where you can test transactions interactively.

## ⚡ Features
- 📊 Train & evaluate a fraud detection model.
- ✅ View **training & testing accuracy**.
- 🌐 Interactive **Streamlit UI** for custom predictions.
- 🔎 Enter transaction details (Time, V1…V28, Amount) and check if it’s fraud or legit.
